# your.agent
A personal agent based on how you see the world

Project Summary
Using Vertex AI, this project's goal is to deploy a personal agent which is able to use all available technology. Technology such a Google Keep, Google Home, Google Calendar, etc. Really, all functionality from The Google Workspace Universe. But, this also means apps or likewise from Samsung, Apple, LG, etc. In this repository, I am using myself as an example (mark.agent). HI!

More about me
I am not a programmer and would be considered a step below novice. In fact, the reason I created a reposity is to tap into githubs network of expertise. On 6/1/25 I was able to install Google Cloud SDK, interact with a agent template from Github. I have two project ideas, but this will be the main one. I give myself 6-12 months to complete this project. That means I would like to have a deployable agent by 6/9/2026.
