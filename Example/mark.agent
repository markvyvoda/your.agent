This file houses information on what I need help with. 

Questions:
1.) Is my approach correct?
1.1.)
To create an agent within Vertex that calls upon functions (e.g. Leading & Lagging Indicators). For example, I would have your.agent as a project in Vertex AI. I have no idea how to program this project which add several key factors. Factors such as agent characteristics, prime directives, etc. 
1.2.) I think I will have to use agent score/weighing to help determine which way the agent will react. For example, based on the heirarchy of weight of prime directives, that will influence the agent. 
2.) In the example, wow will this agent be able to access the parameters I set for it?
2.1.) Prime Directives
